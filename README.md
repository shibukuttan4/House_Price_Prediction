# House Price Prediction

Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict property prices, providing valuable insights for buyers, sellers, and investors in the real estate market.

## Overview

In this project, we have:

- Loaded and explored the California Housing dataset, a well-known dataset containing various property features and their corresponding prices.
- Conducted data preprocessing, including handling missing values, exploring statistical measures, and understanding feature correlations.
- Trained a robust machine learning model using the XGBoost regressor, known for its performance in regression tasks.
- Evaluated the model's performance on both training and testing data, using metrics such as R-squared error and Mean Absolute Error.
- Visualized the results, allowing stakeholders to gain insights into predicted property prices.

## Project Structure

The project's structure is as follows:

- `house_price_prediction.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- `data`: This directory contains the dataset used in the project.
- `README.md`: The README file you're currently reading, providing an overview of the project.
